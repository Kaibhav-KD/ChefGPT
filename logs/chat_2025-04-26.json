    "bot_response": "I can't physically make a biryani for you, as I'm a text-based AI. However, I can provide you with a delicious and relatively simple recipe:\n\n**Chicken Biryani (Serves 4-6)**\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* **For the Chicken Marinade:**\n    * 1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces\n    * 1 cup plain yogurt\n    * 2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste\n    * 1 tbsp biryani masala (store-bought or homemade - see note below)\n    * 1 tsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)\n    * 1 tsp turmeric powder\n    * 1 tsp coriander powder\n    * 1/2 tsp cumin powder\n    * 1/2 tsp garam masala\n    * 1/4 cup chopped cilantro\n    * 1/4 cup chopped mint\n    * 2 tbsp lemon juice\n    * Salt to taste\n\n* **For the Rice:**\n    * 2 cups basmati rice, soaked in water for 30 minutes\n    * 4 cups water\n    * 2 bay leaves\n    * 4 green cardamom pods\n    * 4 cloves\n    * 1-inch cinnamon stick\n    * 1 tsp salt\n\n* **For the Biryani:**\n    * 1/4 cup ghee (or vegetable oil)\n    * 2 large onions, thinly sliced\n    * 1/2 cup fried onions (store-bought or homemade)\n    * Saffron strands, soaked in 1/4 cup warm milk\n    * 1/4 cup chopped cilantro\n    * 1/4 cup chopped mint\n\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Marinate the Chicken:** In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients for the chicken marinade. Mix well and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight in the refrigerator.\n\n2. **Cook the Rice:** In a large pot, bring the water to a boil. Add the bay leaves, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt.  Add the soaked and drained rice. Bring back to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the rice is about 70% cooked (slightly firm). Drain the rice and set aside.\n\n3. **Saut\u00e9 the Onions:** Heat the ghee in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and saut\u00e9 until golden brown and caramelized. This will take about 15-20 minutes. Remove half of the caramelized onions and set aside.\n\n4. **Layer and Cook the Biryani:** In the same pot, layer half of the cooked rice over the remaining caramelized onions. Spread half of the marinated chicken over the rice. Sprinkle half of the fried onions, saffron milk, and chopped cilantro and mint. Repeat the layers with the remaining rice, chicken, fried onions, saffron milk, and herbs.  Top with the reserved caramelized onions.\n\n5. **Dum Cooking:** Cover the pot tightly with a lid or aluminum foil. Place the pot on a very low heat or over a tawa (flat griddle) to create a gentle, indirect heat. Cook for 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the chicken to cook through.\n\n6. **Serve:** Gently fluff the biryani with a fork before serving. Garnish with extra fried onions, cilantro, and mint. Serve hot with raita (yogurt dip) and your favorite Indian sides.\n\n\n**Note:**\n\n* **Biryani Masala:** You can find pre-made biryani masala in most Indian grocery stores. Alternatively, you can make your own by blending together spices like coriander seeds, cumin seeds, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon, black peppercorns, star anise, bay leaves, and dried red chilies.\n\n* **Fried Onions:**  Fried onions (birista) add a wonderful crunch and flavor to the biryani. You can buy them ready-made or fry them yourself by thinly slicing onions and deep-frying them until golden brown.\n\nEnjoy your homemade biryani! Remember to adjust the spice levels to your preference.  Let me know if you have any other questions.\n"
